# Tome

A hierarchical project planning app, catered to small teams working on big projects.

## How Tome Can Help in Your Next Project

Miller's Law states that the average person can keep between 5 and 9 items in working memory at any given time. When working on large projects—especially as a solo developer or in a small team—cognitive load can quickly escalate, leading to disorganized, unfocused work and decision fatigue.

Tome is designed to combat this by providing a structured, hierarchical approach to project planning. By allowing you to break tasks into manageable chunks, Tome helps you stay focused on solving well-defined problems rather than wasting mental energy figuring out what the problem is as you go. This structured approach promotes a clearer workflow, reducing the risk of burnout and improving overall productivity.

## How Does Tome Differ from Other Apps in the Space?

Many project management tools, such as GitHub Issues or Jira, are designed with large distributed teams in mind. While these tools excel at tracking tasks and coordinating across multiple contributors, they often introduce unnecessary complexity for indie developers and small teams who don’t have dedicated project management support.

Tome simplifies task management by offering an intuitive, locally hosted, and fully controlled to-do app that integrates the best aspects of issue tracking while stripping away unnecessary overhead. Instead of forcing users to navigate bloated interfaces, Tome presents a streamlined, distraction-free environment optimized for deep work.

## Key Features That Set Tome Apart:

- **Hierarchical Task Structure** – Organize work in a way that makes sense for you, breaking down large tasks into smaller, actionable pieces.

- **Local-First Approach** – Keep full control over your project data without relying on external cloud services or subscriptions.

- **Context-Rich Task Management** – Link notes, issues, and files directly to tasks, creating an information hub that reduces the need for constant context-switching.

- **Flow-State Optimization** – Stay in the zone by having all relevant information at your fingertips, reducing the time spent searching for notes and related documents.

- **Minimalist Yet Powerful** – Unlike feature-bloated enterprise tools, Tome is designed to be simple and effective, tailored for solo developers and small teams.

Rather than forcing users to dig through endless documents or scattered notes, Tome encourages proactive prelinking of relevant information. This means that when you sit down to tackle a task, everything you need is already organized and easily accessible. By eliminating friction in task management, Tome helps maintain momentum, keeping you in a productive flow state.

Whether you’re building a game, an app, or any long-term project, Tome provides the structure you need to stay focused, organized, and efficient without the hassle of traditional project management tools.
